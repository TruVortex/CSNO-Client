Created as the final project for my ICS4U course, CSNO exists through smart usage of linear algebra (with some room for mathematical abuse). Indeed, the project's ambitious size, contrasting with the short timeframe, lends itself to a few minor visual bugs. However, these have no effect on gameplay, and have less priority than the, admittedly, lack of visual clarity in the game.

To begin, the controls omit a *very* important game mechanic: reloading. Here are the full controls: `WASD` for movement, `123` to change weapon, `R` to reload, and left click to shoot. In a similar vein, players can only find that I have implemented movement error by feel.

Next, I found it very hard to give players visual feedback, whether they were being shot at or were shooting other players. In fact, most of the feedback in the game is exclusively in hard to see corners of the screen. Not ideal.

These issues notwithstanding, I hope you have fun playing this game, and aim to fix the problems soon.
